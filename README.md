# material_prediction
The objective of this project is to discover patterns in the materials data and then make predictions using machine learning algorithms to answer engineering questions, detect and analyse, predict trends and help solve problems. The user feed in material properties to the code and the code helps the user to identify to which type of material it belongs. In this project the user feeds in material properties like density, elasticity and strength and finds out whether it is a polymer or ceramic or metal.
